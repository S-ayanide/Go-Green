# Go Green

This app is an initiative taken to reduce the adverse effect on Climate Change and make the people aware about the best practice to reduce the possibility of harming not just the environment but also making severe climate change less prone.

This app aims to help the environment by planting trees and thus provides the choice to gift someone a tree which will go straight to a charity fund who would be responsible for planting trees.

# Hack 20

The second-annual international hackathon organised by the global Flutter Community. This year, it is an online-only event. Participants will join teams of 1-5 people from the world. You can collaborate remotely using whatever platform youâ€™d like. Each team will be asked to build an app on themes (Saving the Planet - what we learned from the pandemic, Retro/ Cyberpunk Future). At the end, all participants will vote on their favorite projects in several rounds of voting. The top 3 winners will receive prizes from the Flutter Community and sponsors - most importantly, bragging rights!
